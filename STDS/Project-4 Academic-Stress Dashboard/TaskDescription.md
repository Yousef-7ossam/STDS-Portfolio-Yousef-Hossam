# Task Description: Academic Stress & Student Depression Analysis

## Project Overview
This project features an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze the mental health landscape of students. By examining factors such as academic pressure, financial stress, and lifestyle habits, the dashboard identifies key correlations that contribute to student depression and overall well-being.

## Objectives
* **Mental Health Assessment:** Visualize the prevalence of depression and suicidal thoughts among different student demographics.
* **Correlational Analysis:** Explore the link between academic pressure, study satisfaction, and mental health outcomes.
* **Lifestyle Impact:** Analyze how sleep duration and dietary habits affect student stress levels.
* **Financial Stress Tracking:** Measure the impact of financial burden on student mental health.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Tableau:** Used for advanced visual analytics and creating interactive dashboard layouts.
* **Data Management:** CSV-based dataset containing detailed student survey responses.

## 1. Student Solution
