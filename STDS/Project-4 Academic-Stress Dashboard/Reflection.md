# Reflection

## What I Learned
* **Advanced Visual Analytics:** I learned how to use Tableau to build interactive dashboards that handle sensitive psychological and academic data.
* **Correlation Identification:** I discovered how to visualize the relationship between lifestyle habits (like sleep and diet) and mental health outcomes (depression and stress).
* **Storytelling with Data:** I learned how to structure a dashboard to guide the user from a general overview (suicidal thoughts) to specific causes (financial and academic pressure).

## What was Challenging
* **Tableau vs. Power BI:** Adapting to Tableau's unique interface and logic after working on previous projects in Power BI was a learning curve.
* **Visualizing Sensitive Topics:** It was challenging to present data about depression and academic stress in a clear, professional way that highlights insights without being overwhelming.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks
* **Tool Diversity:** I have successfully expanded my portfolio to include multiple BI tools (Excel, Power BI, and now Tableau), showing versatility.
* **In-Depth Analysis:** This project involves a deeper analytical focus on correlational factors rather than just reporting sales or performance metrics.
* **Standardized Documentation:** I am now fully consistent in providing a TaskDescription and Reflection file for every project in the STDS folder.
