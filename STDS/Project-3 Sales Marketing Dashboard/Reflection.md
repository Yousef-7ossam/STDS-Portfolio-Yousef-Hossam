# Reflection

## What I Learned
* **Advanced Data Integration:** I learned how to combine multiple CSV files (Sales, Targets, Stock) into a unified data model using Power BI.
* **KPI Management:** I gained experience in creating gauges and indicators to track performance against specific business targets.
* **Marketing Metrics:** I developed a deeper understanding of marketing conversion funnels and how to visualize them effectively.

## What was Challenging
* **Relationship Complexity:** Managing many-to-many or complex relationships between sales data and marketing targets required careful attention to the data model.
* **Data Cleaning (Power Query):** Handling different formats in the CSV files, especially the "Country Flag" and "Sales Target" data, to ensure consistency.

## What I Improved from Previous Tasks
* **Dashboard Layering:** Compared to my previous projects, I improved the layout by creating specific "views" (Executive, Customer, Marketing) rather than putting all information on one page.
* **Asset Organization:** I have become more organized in managing the "Data" and "image Dashboard" folders to ensure all links in the documentation remain functional.
