# Reflection: Furniture Sales Dashboard

## 1. What I Learned
During this task, I gained and applied several key technical and analytical skills:
**Automated Data Cleaning:** I learned how to use Power Query to automate the cleaning process, ensuring that data is consistently formatted without manual intervention.
**Time-Series Analysis:** I learned how to extract months and calculate durations (Shipping Time) to analyze operational efficiency. 
**Interactive Visualization:** I mastered the use of Slicers and Pivot Charts to create a user-friendly dashboard that allows for dynamic data exploration.
**Financial Data Formatting:** I learned the importance of proper currency and locale settings for accurate financial reporting. 

## 2. What Was Challenging
I encountered a few technical hurdles during this project:
* **Regional Settings Errors:** One of the main challenges was dealing with date format errors in Power Query.I had to identify that the issue was caused by system locale settings and resolved it by switching to English (United States) standards.
  **Layout Design:** Balancing the visual elements on the dashboard to ensure it remains professional and easy to navigate while containing multiple KPIs and charts was a creative challenge.
  **Data Transformation Logic:** Crafting the right custom columns in Power Query to accurately represent shipping durations required careful logical thinking. 

## 3. What I Improved from Previous Tasks
Compared to my earlier work or introductory exercises, I have made significant progress in:
**Professional Documentation:** I am now following a structured portfolio specification, ensuring that every task has a clear description and a mandatory reflection.
**From Manual to Automated:** I shifted from cleaning data manually in Excel cells to using Power Query, which is a much more scalable and professional approach. 
**Attention to Detail:** I improved my ability to spot data inconsistencies (like date formats) early in the process rather than at the visualization stage.
