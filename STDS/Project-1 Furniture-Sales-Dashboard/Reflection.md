# Reflection: Furniture Sales Dashboard

## 1. What I Learned
During this task, I gained and applied several key technical and analytical skills:
* [cite_start]**Automated Data Cleaning:** I learned how to use Power Query to automate the cleaning process, ensuring that data is consistently formatted without manual intervention. [cite: 37]
* [cite_start]**Time-Series Analysis:** I learned how to extract months and calculate durations (Shipping Time) to analyze operational efficiency. [cite: 37]
* [cite_start]**Interactive Visualization:** I mastered the use of Slicers and Pivot Charts to create a user-friendly dashboard that allows for dynamic data exploration. [cite: 37]
* [cite_start]**Financial Data Formatting:** I learned the importance of proper currency and locale settings for accurate financial reporting. [cite: 37]

## 2. What Was Challenging
I encountered a few technical hurdles during this project:
* **Regional Settings Errors:** One of the main challenges was dealing with date format errors in Power Query. [cite_start]I had to identify that the issue was caused by system locale settings and resolved it by switching to English (United States) standards. [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]**Layout Design:** Balancing the visual elements on the dashboard to ensure it remains professional and easy to navigate while containing multiple KPIs and charts was a creative challenge. [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]**Data Transformation Logic:** Crafting the right custom columns in Power Query to accurately represent shipping durations required careful logical thinking. [cite: 38]

## 3. What I Improved from Previous Tasks
Compared to my earlier work or introductory exercises, I have made significant progress in:
* [cite_start]**Professional Documentation:** I am now following a structured portfolio specification, ensuring that every task has a clear description and a mandatory reflection. [cite: 39]
* [cite_start]**From Manual to Automated:** I shifted from cleaning data manually in Excel cells to using Power Query, which is a much more scalable and professional approach. [cite: 39]
* [cite_start]**Attention to Detail:** I improved my ability to spot data inconsistencies (like date formats) early in the process rather than at the visualization stage. [cite: 39]
